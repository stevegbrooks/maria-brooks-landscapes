            <h1><strong>Gardens</strong></h1>
            Our projects can be as small as replanting an existing perennial bed or new installation for a large estate. 
            We do perennial borders, courtyards, intimate patio borders, large perimeter beds, 
            foundation plantings for new construction, deer-proof gardens and everything in between.
          </p>
          <p> 
            <h3>Right Plant, Right Place</h3>
            The idea of finding the right plant for the right place has become a truism in landscape design, but we take it seriously.
            Here are some of the things we consider in planning a garden:
            <ul>
              <li>Your expectations and preferences</li>
              <li>Deer resistance</li>
              <li>Sun exposure</li>
              <li>Soil type and drainage</li>
              <li>Water conditions</li>
              <li>Attraction of butterflies and birds</li>
              <li>Plant height, shape, texture, color</li>
              <li>Seasonal interest</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            Although many projects involve only soome of these steps, the overall process starts with a site assessment,
            followed by design, including positioning and extent of law, beds and hardscaping;
            terrain preparation; soil amendmnet; planting; irrigation and lighting;
            mulching; and cleanup.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Support</h3>
            If gardens are to reach their potential, they need regular attention and maintenance.
            After completion of a project, we can provide an illustrated <i>Plant Portfolio</i>, including a
            fertilizing and maintenance guide, to provide pointers for when and how to maintain the
            plantings. On request, we can develop a maintenance program and provide the service.
            Typically, we do cleanup, pruning, and fertilizing in early spring; trimming and weeding 
            through the summer; and cleanup and winter preparation in the fall.
